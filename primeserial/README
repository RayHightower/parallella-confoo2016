The purpose of this project is to show the advantages of parallel vs serial programming in a very simple, computationally intensive task: finding prime numbers. Both the serial and parallel versions use the same algorithm, so the only difference is the environment.

To compile:
	`make serial`

To run:
	`./primes`
